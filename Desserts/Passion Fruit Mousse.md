Prep Time: 10 minutes
Cook Time: 10 minutes
Total Time: 20 minutes (+ 4 hours chilling time)
Serves: 4

#### Ingredients:
Coconut Almond Crumble
- 1 cup #Graham_Cracker crumbs
- 1 cup sliced #Almonds
- 4 oz unsweetened flaked #Coconut 
- 1/4 cup granulated #Sugar
- 1 tsp #Salt
- 1/2 cup melted #Butter
 
Passion Fruit Mousse
- 8 whole #Passionfruit 
- 1 can (14 oz) organic sweetened #Condensed_Milk
- 2 cups organic #Heavy_Cream (whipping)
 
#### Method:
1. Coconut Almond Crumble: Preheat oven to 350Â°F. In a bowl, mix together graham cracker crumbs, almonds, coconut, sugar, and salt; drizzle melted butter over top, stirring until combined. Press into baking pan; toast in oven for 7 to 9 minutes or until firm. Crumble mixture into the bowl; let cool.
2. Passion Fruit Mousse: Cut passion fruits in half; using a spoon, scrape pulp into a bowl, using a little water to help rinse the juice out from the skin. Soften pulp with hands; strain in sieve or cheesecloth set over large bowl, pressing down with a ladle to extract as much juice as possible. Discard seeds. Stir condensed milk into juice.
3. In a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold one-third of the cream into the passion fruit mixture, then quickly fold in remaining cream until no streaks remain. Spoon into 4 parfait glasses and refrigerate for 4 hours.
4. Just before serving, sprinkle each serving with 1 tbsp Coconut Almond Crumble. (Reserve remaining Coconut Almond Crumble in a sealed container for another use.)
