10oz 280g. #Chocolate (I like to use 70% or higher cocoa content)
4oz. 115g. #Butter
6ea. whole #Egg (separated)
1/4c 50g. #Sugar
2T. 30g. #Sugar

Preheat your oven to 350. Put your chocolate and butter into a boil and place over a pan of simmering water to melt. While your chocolate is melting prepare your pan by liberally buttering it and dusting an even layer of cocoa powder around it. Put your egg yolks into a kitchen aid mixing bowl and begin whisking at medium speed, once it starts to thicken add your first measure of sugar (50g) in a steady stream. Whip until it reaches ribbon stage (when a ribbon of egg yolk will rest on the mixture for a second before sinking). Once your chocolate is melted, flavor it how you like! This is the time to add spices, liquor, vanilla, coffee or things like that. Always add a good amount of salt. Once your egg yolks are ready fold them into your chocolate mixture. Clean out your mixing bowl and add your egg whites. Begin whipping on medium speed. Once the egg whites begin to fluff up and you can start to see tracks in the top add your sugar in a steady stream. Whisk until they reach medium stiff peaks. Fold your whites into the chocolate mixture in two additions. Pour mixture into your pan and bake for 25 -30 minutes or until the center is just set. Let cool out of the water bath but in the pan for 10 - 15 minutes. Run a sharp knife around the edges and turn out onto a plate. Garnish with fruit, whipped creme fraiche or yogurt. Enjoy with a very strong espresso or a good cognac.
