# Macarons


Shell Recipe 

300g 3c #Almond_Meal 
300g 3c #Powdered_Sugar
110g ~4ea Aged #Egg_Whites (proteins are relaxed, higher volume whip)
300g 1 1/2c #Granulated_Sugar
75g 1/3c #Water
Grind together almond meal and powdered sugar in a food processor and sift into a large bowl. It’s ok if you don’t have a processor, you can just sift the meal and sugar together. If you are using a dry coloring or flavoring (matcha, cocoa powder, turmeric, ground tea etc) sift this in now as well. If you are using a gel food dye combine it into your first measure of egg whites. Pour the egg whites onto your almond meal/sugar mix and set aside. Put your granulated sugar and water (you can also use tea or other infusions to substitute the water) in a sauce pan and set on medium heat. When your sugar begins to bubble begin to whip your egg whites. Cook your sugar to softball stage or 244 degrees Fahrenheit. Slowly add your sugar syrup into your beating egg whites in a steady stream. Whip on high until cool and stiff peaks form. Fold your egg whites into the almond meal/powdered sugar/egg white mix until it is glossy and has a consistency of thick liquid “lava-like” batter consistency. Fit a piping bag with a 1/2in piping tip (or don’t, no big deal). Pipe your macarons onto your parchment or Silpat about 1 1/2 inches in diameter and 3/4 inches apart. Rap your sheet pan on the counter precisely 10 times. Set aside for approximately 30 minutes. This will take more or less time depending on the humidity and heat of your kitchen. You are looking for a skin to form on the outside of your macaron shell. Your finger should come away clean if you gently press the top. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees. Bake for 10-12 minutes, opening the oven a couple times to release steam and rotate. Macarons should be set and firm. Let cool. 
Buttercream Recipe 

90g 3ea Egg Whites
150g 3/4c Sugar
225g 8oz Soft Butter
Put your egg whites and sugar into the bowl of your stand mixer. Whisk to combine. Heat egg whites and sugar mix over a double boiler until warm to the touch. Transfer to your stand mixer and beat on high until stiff peaks form. Beat your softened butter into the egg whites. Don’t worry if it looks broken! It will come together I promise! Feel free to switch to your paddle attachment. Add whatever flavoring you like. Seriously, this buttercream will hold up to pretty much anything. 
To Assemble 
Match your shells according to size. Laying them out in rows with one side up and one side down. Pipe your filling in. If you are adding another textural element (pate de fruit, candied ginger, dried fruit, English peas) press them into the middle of your buttercream. Gently press the top shell onto the buttercream. Macaron are best a day or two after they have been made. The time in the fridge allows the shell to soften and the flavors to mature. When serving just allow them to come to room temperature. Enjoy!! \u2028
Some Common Problems and Troubleshooting 

Macarons did not form feet - skin did not properly develop 
batter too wet or meringue was broken
oven temp too low 
Macarons are too thin and spread out - batter was over mixed 
Macarons have nipples - Batter was under mixed

Macarons are hollow - Egg whites were under whipped
Egg whites were broken 
Shells were under baked

Macarons are browning - Oven temperature is too high or your pan is too close to the heat. 
Remedy this by decreasing temp or putting an empty sheet pan above your shells. 

Macarons are rising lopsided - Piping may have been wonky. Pipe straight up and down 
Oven fan may be too strong, turn off or rotate often. 
Baking temp may be too high. 
Macarons are lumpy - Make sure you’re sifting the almond meal and sugar

Macarons are wrinkled with a wet spot in the middle - Oven temp is too low
Batter was over mixed
Almond meal was old 
If you have a problem that was not covered in this please don’t hesitate to reach out and ask me! Remember that macarons are an exercise in patience and frustration. There are many factors that play into making or breaking them. Don’t get disheartened if they don’t work out the first couple of times! Your oven is different than my oven. Your kitchen may run hot and dry. My kitchen is insanely humid because I have about 200 houseplants. All of these things will change the outcome of your macarons. Part of the fun is figuring out what the perfect formula is for YOU. They are one of my absolute favorite things to make for a reason, you can flavor them pretty much any way you like, they are gorgeous and on top of that delicious. I hope that this will be a fun new skill to learn and impress all your friends with. Thank you again for joining me, happy baking!
