Re: Previous Streams!
Hello! So glad you had a good time, thank you again for joining me. I always have such a blast doing them, it's great to hear that people actually enjoy them and feel like they're learning something! Here is the cookie recipe and stream link! Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Very Excellent Chocolate Chip Cookies

200g 14T Butter 
150. 3/4c #Brown_Sugar
100g. 1/2c. #Sugar
1ea. #Egg
1ea. #Egg_Yolk
1t #Vanilla_Extract
1t #Salt
250g 1 3/4c AP #Flour
5g. 1/2t. #Baking_Soda
300g. 1 1/2c. Chocolate Chips
In a saucepan brown your butter (this is the stage where I add tea infusions like chai, hojicha etc). Transfer to a mixing bowl and let cool. Add your sugars and mix to combine, followed by the eggs, vanilla and any other wet ingredients you would like to incorporate (like miso, shio koji, tahini). You want to whisk the mixture until it gets light in color and appears to have doubled in size. Add your dry ingredients (including any dry additions like matcha) and combine until it forms a dough. Mix in your chocolate chips (an any additions like nuts, dried fruit, coconut). If the dough is too wet chill for 30 minutes. Form the dough into flat cylinders and if you have the patience, chill overnight. When the dough is ready bake at 325 or 350 depending on whether you use a convection or not. Bake for 5-7 minutes until the edges are caramelized and the center is golden brown.
Some notes on the additions that we discussed in the class:
ADD FUN SALT! Whether it is adding miso, smoked salt or sprinkling Maldon salt on top of the cookie before it bakes, the salt measurement in the recipe is low to allow you to season to taste.
Infusions like teas work very well to impart a unique flavor to your cookie.
Thank you for reaching out! I hope this is helpful to you, and hope to see you at the next one!
