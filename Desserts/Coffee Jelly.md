    Place the coffee into the filter in the dripper. Even out the grounds making a flat surface. The water should be about 90째C (194째F). Slowly pour just enough water in the dripper to moisten the grounds. Let it sit for 30 seconds.

    Continue to slowly drip the water over the grounds until you have about 250ml or 1 cup of coffee. Remove the dripper to avoid the last few drops as they can add a bitter astringent taste to the coffee.

Recipe Notes

Regular milk, evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk can be used instead of the whipping cream.
Make sure it is well chilled. The jelly will begin to melt if it gets too hot.
The aroma of the coffee and the refreshing texture make the jelly so delicious.
