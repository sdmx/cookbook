In the Style of: #Sophia_Roe [Youtube](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/all-dressed-up-cauliflower-rice)

#### Ingredients:

4 Servings

- 1 medium head of #Cauliflower (about 2¼ lb.), broken into florets
- 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin #Olive_Oil 
- 1 medium red #Bell_Peppers , finely chopped
- 1 #Shallot, finely chopped
- 2 #Garlic cloves, finely grated
- 1 Tbsp. #Curry_Powder
- 1 tsp. ground #Turmeric 
- ½ tsp. ground #Coriander_Seeds 
- ¾ cup canned unsweetened #Coconut_Milk
- 1 tsp. finely grated #Lime zest
- 1 Tbsp. fresh #Lime juice
- 1 tsp. coconut sugar or granulated #Sugar 
- Kosher #Salt 
- ¼ cup golden #Raisins 
- ¼ cup coarsely chopped #Cilantro
- ¼ cup unsalted, roasted #Pumpkin_Seeds (pepitas)
- ¼ cup coarsely chopped #Mint, plus torn leaves for serving
- Plain whole-milk Greek #Yogurt and lime wedges (for serving; optional)

#### Method:
- Working in 2 batches, pulse cauliflower in a food processor until pieces are about the size of rice (you don’t want to overprocess; err on the large side). Transfer cauliflower to a medium bowl lined with a kitchen towel to absorb any extra moisture.
- Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add bell pepper, shallot, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallot and garlic are softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle in curry powder, turmeric, and coriander and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add coconut milk, lime zest, lime juice, and coconut sugar; season with salt. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add cauliflower and raisins; cook, tossing occasionally, until cauliflower is just tender, about 3 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if needed.
- Add cilantro, pumpkin seeds, and ¼ cup mint to cauliflower rice and toss to combine. Divide among bowls; top with a dollop of yogurt if using and torn mint. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over if desired.
