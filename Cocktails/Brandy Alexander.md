# Brandy Alexander
In the style of: #Alinea_Group 

In The Office: Classic Cocktails, we learn what it takes to make a truly great cocktail
by studying the classics. At a glance, classic cocktail recipes often seem deceptively
simple: few ingredients, a bit of splashing around with ice, maybe a garnish. But there is elegance in this simplicity, and lessons to be learned about the harmony and balance one can achieve using as few ingredients as possible. An “alexander” cocktail is similar in style to that of a flip (which we discuss on page 108 of the book), the primary difference lying in the use of cream rather than egg to balance the beverage. When shaking alexanders, the shattering ice tends to aerate the cream, effectively whipping it in the shaker. This yields a texture many might describe as “fluffy”.The Brandy Alexander can be viewed as a versatile template; while we specify cognac below, any brandy that pairs well with chocolate flavors (introduced by the crème de cacao) works just as well. Alternatively, one may also experi-ment by swapping the liqueur as well as the base spirit: some examples might include pineapple liqueur with a rum base, or coffee liqueur with a bourbon or rye base.
