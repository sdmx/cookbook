# Mexican Mocha Scones

Serves: 8 mexican mocha scones

#### Ingredients:

⅓ cup #Sugar
2 teaspoons #Baking_Powder
¾ teaspoon #Salt
¼ #Cocoa_Powder
1 tablespoon #Ground_Coffee
¼ teaspoon #Cayenne_Pepper
¾ cup [[Mexican Mocha Scones#Cinnamon Chips|Cinnamon_Chips]]
1 cup full-fat canned #Coconut_Milk

#### Method:
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, and lightly dust two spots with flour.
2. Line pan with cinnamon chips and set in freezer for 5-10 minutes
3. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cocoa powder, coffee and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl.
4. Add the cinnamon chips to the flour, and toss lightly to coat, breaking up any berry
clumps.
5. Drizzle in ¾ cup of the coconut milk and add the vanilla. Stir to bring everything together. Drizzle in more coconut milk as needed (I use 1 cup total) to get a cohesive dough that is somewhat workable but not too sticky.
6. Divide the dough in half and place both on the prepared baking sheet. Gently pat each into a circle that is roughly ¾ to 1-inch high. Place in the freezer while you preheat your oven to 425ºF. 6. Once the oven is preheated, remove the baking sheet from the freezer and cut each disk into 4 wedges. Pull the wedges apart about 1 inch to give them a little
space.
7. Brush the tops of the dough with a little coconut milk.
8. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. Let cool for 5 minutes. Can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or individually frozen for longer.
