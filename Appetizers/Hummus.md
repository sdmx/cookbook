# Hummus
*In the style of:* #Yotam_Ottolenghi

**Ingredients**
- 60 g [[Hummus##Tahini Sauce|Tahini Sauce]]
- 12 confit #Garlic cloves, plus 4 tbsp [[Hummus#Confit Garlic Oil|Confit Garlic Oil]]
- 550 g cooked #Chickpeas (see [[Hummus#Cooked Chickpeas|Cooked Chickpeas]], right, or canned)
- 180 g to 210 g #Tahini_Paste (depending on brand)
- Kosher #Salt 
- 1/4 cup #Lemon_Juice
- 5 tbsp plus 2 tsp ice-cold #Water, plus extra
- 1½ tbsp #Parsley, finely chopped 

**Method**
- Make the [[Hummus##Tahini Sauce|Tahini Sauce]].
- Make the [[Hummus#Confit Garlic Oil|Confit Garlic Oil]].
- Set about 100 grams of the cooked chickpeas (below) aside in a small bowl.
- Add the remaining chickpeas, tahini paste, 8 of the confit garlic cloves, ½ teaspoon salt, and the lemon juice to the bowl of a food processor and blitz until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes.
- With the machine running, slowly drizzle in the ice water until completely smooth and aerated. You may have to add slightly more water to reach the desired texture. Taste and adjust for seasoning if necessary.
- Add the parsley, 2 tablespoons of Confit Garlic Oil, and a pinch of salt to the bowl with the reserved chickpeas, and stir to combine. Set aside.
- Transfer the hummus to a shallow platter and smooth it out with the back of a spoon, creating a slight well in the center. (It’s okay if the hummus is a little runny; hummus will set as it cools.)
- Spread the Tahini Sauce into the well, then spoon the herbed chickpea mixture over the top of the tahini. Top the dish with the remaining confit garlic cloves along with some of the aromatics in the jar (thyme and chili).
- Finish with a drizzle of Confit Garlic Oil.

## Cooked Chickpeas
**Ingredients** 
- 200 g dried #Chickpeas
- 1½ tsp #Baking_Soda, divided
- 1 tsp #Salt

**Method**
- Soak the chickpeas overnight in a large bowl with enough cold water to cover by several inches, plus 1 teaspoon of baking soda.
- Drain and refresh, then add to a large pot with enough water to cover by 2 to 3 inches and the remaining ½ teaspoon of baking soda.
- Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to medium, cover with a lid, and cook for at least 30 minutes and up to 60 minutes, skimming the top as necessary, until soft enough to crush between two fingers.
- Remove the lid, add the salt, and continue to cook for 15 minutes to season the chickpeas. Drain and set aside until ready to use.
