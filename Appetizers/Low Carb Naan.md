Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Coconut flour
- 1.5 tbsp psyllium husk powder
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 1-1.5 cups hot water
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic (optional)
- 1/4 tsp Pink Himalayan Salt

Instructions

- NOTE: We made 6 naan out of our dough for 2 servings. 3 naan per serving.
- Combine the coconut flour, psyillium husk powder, baking powder, salt and coconut oil. Add the minced garlic to the mixture. 
- Add 1 cup of hot water to start and combine. Add more hot water if needed. If the consistency is too wet add more psyllium husk powder
- Knead with your hands for a minute and let it sit in a bowl for 15 minutes.
- Pull apart the dough into as big or as little balls as you'd like and roll out using some parchment paper and a rolling pin.
- Heat a skillet to medium heat and add a naan to the heated skillet. Flip after a couple minutes (it will be brown on the other side), and cook until browned on both sides.
- Tip: If the naan starts to puff up, you know its done!
- Complete until all naans are cooked and enjoy!
