# Slow Cooker Frittata with Artichoke Heart

#### Ingredients:
- 14 oz. can small #Artichoke_hearts, drained and cut into small pieces (you can use artichokes that are already cut, which are cheaper)
- 12 oz. jar roasted #Red_Peppers. drained and cut into small pieces
- 1/4 cup sliced #Green_Onions
- 8 whole #Egg, beaten well until yolks and whites are completely combined
- 4 oz. crumbled #Feta_Cheese
- #Spike_Seasoning to taste, I used about 1 tsp. (if you don’t have Spike, any all-purpose seasoning will work, see notes) fresh-ground black pepper to taste
- 2 T chopped #Parsley for garnish (optional)

#### Method:
- Pour out artichoke hearts into a colander placed in the sink and let them drain well.
- While artichokes drain, slice the green onions and crumble the feta.
- Spray the slow cooker insert well with non-stick spray.
- Remove artichoke hearts to the cutting board and pour out the roasted red peppers into the colander to drain.
- Cut the artichoke hearts into fairly small pieces (quarters, or smaller if they’re large) and put them in the bottom of the slow cooker insert.
- Cut the drained red peppers into pieces about 1/2 inch square and put them into the slow cooker.
- Add the green onions to the slow cooker.
- Beat the eggs until whites and yolks are completely combined and then pour eggs over the vegetables in the slow cooker.
- Use a fork to gently stir, so the artichoke pieces, red pepper pieces, and sliced green onions are well distributed.
- Sprinkle the crumbled Feta over the top and season with Spike Seasoning (affiliate link) and freshly-ground black pepper.
- Cook on low for 2-3 hours or until the eggs are as firm as you’d like them and the cheese is melted.  (I cooked mine about 2 1/2 hours, but I think the Ninja might cook a little hotter than some other slow cookers.
- Cut into pieces while the frittata is still in the slow cooker.
- Serve hot, sprinkled with chopped parsley to garnish if desired.
