With winter coming I figured I should submit this recipe for the best soup I've ever tasted and the soup that signifies the holiday season for myself and my family. My entire family is full blooded Irish but my great grandpa was raised by his aunt and uncle who came to the Untied States in the 30's from Italy so for generations our Christmas feasts have always been Italian and therefore awesome. This soup is called Zuppa Toscana which if I'm not mistaken translated to "Tuscan Soup". I will include the ingredients and recipe to follow. I hope you imgurians will like it.
