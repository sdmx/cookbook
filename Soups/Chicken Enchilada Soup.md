**Method**
*For the soup:* In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add to the slow-cooker along with the broth, tomato sauce, chipotle in adobo, cilantro, beans, tomatoes, corn, cumin, and oregano. Add the chicken breasts. Cover and cook on low for 4 to 6 hours.

Remove the chicken, shred it with two forks, and return it to the slow cooker.

**For the toppings:** To serve, ladle into 6 serving bowls and dividing evenly, top each with 2 tablespoons of cheddar, scallions, cilantro, avocado, and sour cream (if using).

**NOTE:** If you’re not a fan of the smoky taste of chipotle peppers, you can replace them with other spicy chiles, such as jalapeños or serranos.
